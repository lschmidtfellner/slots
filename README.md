# Project 1 - Luke Schmidt-Fellner

## Digital Slot Machine

## Project Description

For my app I decided to go with a slot machine game. I wanted to chose something with a lot of extra space for graphics, and a thematically appropriate game for flashy visuals. I'm taking inspiration from the slot machine mini-game from the original pokemon games, as well as existing online slot machines. The goal is to get 3 in a row either across or diagonally from a 3x3 grid of displayed symbols.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to recognize three matching symbols in a row or diagonally.
- As a player, I want the amount of money have I left and have wagered to be clear at all times.
- As a player, like to know when I win and how much I win.
- I will use a random number generator to decide the position of each wheel, or at least for each icon position in the 3x3 grid.
- As a player, I want UI for adding and cashing out funds.
- As a player, I want a clear ruleset explaining how to game works.
- As a player, I would like to have the number of potential directions to match symbols to increase incrementally with wagers (i.e., one wager is the center row, two wagers is two rows, three is all 3 rows, and 4 is diagonal)

#### Stretch Goals

- I would like to add at least one bonus symbol (bar equivalent) that adds an exponential function.
- I would like to add one wild card symbol that functions as a substitute.
- I would like to put together original graphics to create a completely fleshed out theme.
- I would like to have the wheels appear to rotate with consistent icon positions.
