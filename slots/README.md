## Digital Slot Machine

## Project Description

For my app I decided to go with a slot machine game. I wanted to chose something with a lot of extra space for graphics, and a thematically appropriate game for flashy visuals. I'm taking inspiration from the slot machine mini-game from the original pokemon games, as well as existing online slot machines. The goal is to get 3 in a row either across or diagonally from a 3x3 grid of displayed symbols.
