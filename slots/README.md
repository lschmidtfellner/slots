## Digital Slot Machine

## Project Description

For my app I decided to go with a slot machine game. I wanted to chose something with a lot of extra space for graphics, and a thematically appropriate game for flashy visuals. I'm taking inspiration from the slot machine mini-game from the original pokemon games, as well as existing online slot machines. The goal is to get 3 in a row either across or diagonally from a 3x3 grid of displayed symbols.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to recognize three matching symbols in a row or diagonally.
- As a player, I want the amount of money have I left and have wagered to be clear at all times.
- As a player, like to know when I win and how much I win.
- I will use a random number generator to decide the position of each wheel, or at least for each icon position in the 3x3 grid.
- As a player, I want UI for adding and cashing out funds.
- As a player, I want a clear ruleset explaining how to game works.

#### Stretch Goals

- I would like to add at least one bonus symbol (bar equivalent) that adds an exponential function.
- I would like to add one wild card symbol that functions as a substitute.
- I would like to put together original graphics to create a completely fleshed out theme.
- I would like to have the wheels appear to rotate with consistent icon positions.
